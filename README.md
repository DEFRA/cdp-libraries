## Release it

This project uses [release-it](https://github.com/release-it) for managing releases. It automates the process of
versioning, tagging, and publishing packages to npm.
It is set up to go. However, if you wish to tweak it, you can do so by modifying the `.release-it.js` file in the root
of workspace package.
